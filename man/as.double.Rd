\title{Numeric Representations}
\usage{
\method{as.double}{qw}(x, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{the object to be converted.}

\item{\dots}{further arguments passed to or from other methods.}
}
\value{
A numeric representation of \code{x}, using a method commonly refered
to as simple substitution.
}
\description{
Converts an object of class "qw" to a numeric values.
}
\note{
The process of simple substitution proceeds in 4 steps for each kind of
censoring: none, interval, left and right.  First uncensored data are
retained as is. Interval-censored data are converted by computing the mid
value. Left-censored data are converted sequentially from the lowest
censoring level, which is set to 1/2 the reporting level, any subsequent
levels are replaced by the mean of all values less than the current reporting
level. Right-censored data are converted sequentially from the largest
censoring level. Each level is replaced by the mean of all values greater
than the current level, beginning with a value 10 percent larger than the
largest censoring level if there are no larger uncensored values.\cr

The function \code{as.double} is executed for \code{as.numeric}.

\examples{
## Create a simple qw object
Test.qw <- as.qw(c(1,2,3,2,4,4), c("<", "<", "<", " ", " ", " "), "", NA_real_,
"Miss", "None", "Mine", "TEST", "")
as.double(Test.qw)
as.numeric(Test.qw)
