\title{Water-Quality Data}
\usage{
importNWISqw(sites, params = "all", begin.date = "", end.date = "",
  keep = NULL, use.pnames = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{sites}{a vector of the USGS station identifiers.}

\item{params}{A character string contains the name of a group of parameter
codes, or a vector of parameter codes. See \bold{Details}.}

\item{begin.date}{the earliest date for data, must be a character with the
format "YYYY-mm-dd."}

\item{end.date}{the latest date for data, must be a character with the format
"YYYY-mm-dd."}

\item{keep}{a character vector for any additional columns to retain from the
retrieved data.}

\item{use.pnames}{create colummn names based on pcode (like P00000)? Default
is to generate more English-like names.}
}
\value{
A data frame of the water-quality data of class "qw" organized by
sample. Column names for the water-quality constituents are generated
automatically, but can be set by the user,
see \code{\link{makeColNames}}.
}
\description{
Valid groups are "all," "information," "physical," "cations,"
"anions," "nutrients," "microbiological," "biological," "metals," "nonmetals,"
"toxicity," "pesticides," "pcbs," "other organics," "radio chemicals,",
"stable isotopes," "sediment," and "population/community." Subject to
availability in the \code{readNWISqw} function in the \code{dataRetrieval}
package.
}
\details{
Import discrete sample water-quality data from NWISweb.
}
\note{
The sample information columns that are automatically retained are the
USGS station identifier, sample date, sample time, time zone code, and medium
code. If composite samples are found in the data, then sample end date and
sample end time are also included. Use the \code{keep} argument to retain more
if needed.\cr

NWIS has several remark codes that have special meaning in addition to "<," which
indicates a left-censored value and ">," which indicates a right censored value.
Most other codes are ignored in processing, but passed through and retained as the
remark code in the data; a warning is printed when special remark codes are retained.
NWIS also uses the remark code "M" to indicate whan a result value is rounded to 0. In
that case, \code{importNWISqw} tries to recode the data as less than the reportiong
level, but is the reporting level is the missing value \code{NA}, the remark code "M"
is retained. Warnings are generated for both conversion and retention of the "M"
remark codes.
